## Hello!
I am An-20, a student in secondary school in the UK. If you are reading this, you have somehow stumbled across my profile. Thanks for taking a look!

- ✏ I’m currently working on various projects, some public and some private. These include Discord bots, some smart contract experimentation, and a closed-source Python algotrading bot.
- 📚 I'm currently learning Solidity and SQL
- 🎨 I have experience in Python, some experience in Solidity and am somewhat familiar with TensorFlow.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I hate avocados. Something more coding related? I once tried to make a mod for KSP. I failed.

And yes, I did go through the effort of making my profile picture dark-mode friendly.
